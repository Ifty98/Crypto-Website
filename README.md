# Crypto-Website

Crypto Dash is a website designed to provide data about different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance-Coin, Solana, and Tether. It offers historical data about these cryptocurrencies over the last 12 months, presented in graphs to facilitate easy understanding for users. Additionally, Crypto Dash provides predictions generated using AWS SageMaker for the upcoming 24 days based on the historical data. Furthermore, it offers graphs illustrating sentiment analysis for each cryptocurrency, providing insights into market sentiment. Moreover, the website displays graphs showcasing synthetic data and its predictions. All numerical and text data are sourced from various APIs and stored in the cloud using DynamoDB. This data is later utilized through Lambda functions for making predictions using AWS SageMaker and performing sentiment analysis using an API. These datasets are stored in DynamoDB and are sent to clients when they connect to the website using the connection ID provided by WebSocket. Whenever new data is uploaded to DynamoDB, connected clients automatically receive the updated data, thanks to a Lambda function triggered by all DynamoDB tables.
